# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my resources I collected for competitive programming. It contains ideas of common algorithms (e.g. Quicksort, Quickselect, etc.) as well as some examples on how to use the standard library in C++.

All solutions are currently written in C++.

## Structure

- **cpp** 
  - Contains notes about STL and the language features (e.g. use of custom comparator in sorting)

- **impl**
  - My own (hopefully flawless) reimplementation of well-established algorithms
  - Used for practicing on how to avoid common errors such as off-by-one errors

- **books**
  - Ideas and code collected from various books


- **codeforces**
  - Solution to problems on ![https://codeforces.com](Codeforces)

## CP Plattforms

The competitive plattforms I use for practicing are:
  - Codeforces
  - UVa
