# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my resources I collected for competitive programming. It contains ideas of common algorithms (e.g. Quicksort, Quickselect, etc.) as well as some examples on how to use the standard library in C++.

All solutions are currently written in C++.

## Structure

- **cp-algorithms**
  - some advanced algorithms implemented from ![https://cp-algorithms.com](this site)

- **topics**
  - Contains a selection of topics that are recurring and very frequent in programming contests.
    Notes and proofs are usually done on paper.
  - Topics are sorted by a very general term (e.g. dynamic programming) and then refined in subfolders
  - Includes:
     - Binary Search
       - Different variations
       - Invariants

- **cpp** 
  - Contains notes about STL and language features (e.g. use of custom comparator in sorting)


- **templates**
  - Folder for templates used during competitive programming contests (cpp/vim settings)
  - Old templates are kept for reference 

- **books**
  - Contains exercises, ideas and code collected from various books
  - folders are named after authors
    - Source code for books only contains snippets useful during contest
      (no complete implementations of well-known/used algorithms)

- **codeforces**
  - Solution to problems on ![https://codeforces.com](Codeforces)

- **codechef**
  - Solutions for problems on ![https://codechef.com](Codechef)

- **leetcode**
  - Solutions for problems on ![https://leetcode.com](Leetcode)
  - Note that I have another repository dedicated to Leetcode: ![https://github.com/git-bauerseb/leetcode-solutions](here)

- **playground**
  - Place for quickly hacking something together

## CP Plattforms

The competitive plattforms I use for practicing are:
  - Codeforces
  - Codechef
  - UVa
  - (Leetcode) (not competitve programming but good site for practicing standard algorithms)
